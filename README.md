# Togedule
It will be an enormous project, depicting the daily or staged schedules for the couples or groups, standing for making progress together.  
The project is intended to be developed by Vue and Java, meaning of the front and rear ends. Thankfully, it's lightly to pick up Vue, while the complete Java Web system is still under my blind zone. Therefore, the author is learning that and coding modestly and lazily, so the DDL is ambiguous. :(
BTW, Togedule's original intention is for Miss Xiao, a beautiful nuclear scientist and I, a happy procrastinator. :)
